            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Controlling can be correlated to the process of quilting. That may sound a little sily, but both activities can involve multiple people working on multiple aspects of the same job, (or quilt) at the same time.<br>
            <br>Using the quiltmaking analogy, let's look at the process of adding:<br>
                One part of the process of making a quilt is called “piecing” the quilt. Piecing is when you take a square (or whatever the shape of the piece of fabric is) and baste, or loosely stitch down the fabric piece to other adjacent pieces, in order to hold the piece in place until you put the “real” stitches down to hold it forever. It gives you a way to add more to the quilt before committing to its placement. In programming, the corollary is taking a working copy of a file and, by using the GIT command, “ git add” (or “baste”) a file or files to the staging area.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In the art of quilting, after a piece has been basted to an area, it's considered to be temporarily held in place. The next step is to sew that piece down for eternity.<br>Similarly, once a computer file is added to the cache, it is then viewed as being “staged” or held, until it can then be “stitched firmly down” so to speak, or committed. The command for committing a file is simply “git commit”.<br>
            <br>
                Just like the piece of fabric for the quilt, the file is no longer “tacked in place” in the staging area, but is now ready to be incorporated into the project’s remote repository.

            <p class="lead">After an afternoon of basting and chatting and working along, some of the fabric pieces for the quilt have now been pieced and then sewn down. It’s time to store the quilt until the next sewing get-together, and so into the cedar chest it goes. It’s being stored there, away from the heat and light and whatever else could harm it.<br>
            <br>
                In computing, files are added (basted) and committed 
                (stitched down for good). After that, it’s time to do the same
                thing with the files--store them--until it’s time to add more
                to the job. It only takes a simple “git push” command in GIT
                to send the files to the remote repository (or cedar chest) for
                safe-keeping.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Once it’s possible to sit and work again, the quilt comes out of the chest and is put back on the rack or quilting table where one or more of the quilting participants can work on the quilt again. <br>
            <br>
                Pulling a computer project (consisting of one or more files of
                possibly different types) from the remote repository works in
                the same way. All that’s needed is the command “git pull”. Then,
                the files (or modified files) are taken, or pulled from the
                remote repository and are put into the local repository (or
                repositories) where the process of modification, or working on
                them, can begin again. Pull is actually a two-step process that
                involves doing a “git fetch” and then a “git merge”.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Let’s say the quilt was going along beautifully, but it was noticed later that some of the stitches were off and needed to come out and be<br>re-sewn. Also, because you know who sat where, you are able to figure out who might be ready for eye glasses. The stitches come out, new ones go in, the person is sees better and all is well.<br>
            <br>
                Computer projects require revisions too (countless amounts), and
                with GIT, it is possible to know where, and by whom and when the
                errors occurred. It’s all part of the histories. So if a file
                needs to be reverted, “git revert” will create a new commit that
                undoes all the work that needs to be removed.</p>
